Trading Engine
==============

This project implements a very simple multi-threaded trading engine
for a securites market. It is based on libcore, and supports creating
a market for trading in multiple securities.

The trading engine code is released under the Modified BSD license.


Prerequisites
=============

The trading engine is dependent on libcore, which is available here:

https://github.com/ChrisWinter/libcore


Building
========

Assuming libcore has been compiled and installed in /usr/local,
then building the trading engine is as simple as:

$ make

If libcore has been installed elsewhere, then specify the location
of libcore's include files and shared library like so:

$ LIBCORE_INCDIR=<path/to/libcore/include/dir> LIBCORE_LIBDIR=<path/to/libcore/libdir> make -e


Running
=======

Start the trading engine server:

$ ./trading-engine

Switch to a different shell, and spawn the test clients that will send orders to
the trading engine server on the localhost:

$ ./spawn_clients.sh

The trading engine server will print out some basic statistics every 5 seconds.

Kill the server with CTRL-C. The test clients will automatically exit when the
server closes the socket.
